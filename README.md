# CS-312-MiniProject- 3
The third project in NAU's CS312 course.

## Description
In Mini-Project-3, you will integrate the PostgreSQL database into your project, allowing blogs to reside in the database and persist between sessions, and do necessary database operations upon user interactions. Furthermore, you will have authentication enabled so that users can only update or delete blogs created by themselves.
